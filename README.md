## Overview

This project was completed as part of my Computer Science Leaving Cert. curriculum, and intends to show how a simplified version of a product like Roomba might be developed.

As you might expect, I couldn't afford bespoke robotic vacuum hardware as a teenager, so I made use of BBC Micro:bits to simulate the self-driving capabilities of such a device.

See the above video for a demonstration of the final product.
