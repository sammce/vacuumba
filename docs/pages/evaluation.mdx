# Evaluation

## Requirements

### Hardware

For the most part, I met the requirements I set for myself. As previously mentioned,
the device lacks vacuum capability, but other than that functions as expected.

The vacuum can do the following, as mentioned in my requirements:

- Communicate with the 'controller' micro:bit via serial port.
- Drive autonomously
- Detect obstacles and avoid them

### Software

The accompanying web interface can do the following, as outlined:

- Display the current state of the vacuum
- Adhere to lesser abled users who may use keyboard navigation or screen readers.

I had to think carefully when designing the site with accessibility in mind,
but I think the additional effort would be more than worth it in a real world
application.

### System

As a whole the system can:

- Store and retrieve data in/from a live database via a web server.
- Allow the user to manually start and stop their vacuum.
- React accordingly to errors and unexpected events such as the vacuum not being turned on.

## In the context of the brief

I believe that the artefact suffiently meets the advanced requirements
(and by extension the basic requirements). It meets them in the following ways:

- The user can control the artefact and monitor information such as room temperature.
- Data is captured via the sensors on the micro:bit.
- The interface consists of various elements (i.e. tables, buttons, labels, inputs, scroll areas etc).
- All inputs/actions are validated on the client side and on the server.

## User needs

The user can do everything I mentioned in the <Link href="./plan.html">Plan</Link> stage,
such as control the vacuum. The biggest challenge was certainly the log in system.
I have implemented similar systems before in production applications, but it was
still challenging nonetheless.

## Conclusion

Overall, I found the process of developing vacuumba to be educational and enjoyable,
while also proving thought provoking in certain areas. It required vast research and
detailed planning, but my rigorous documentation was invaluable as the development process
unraveled.
