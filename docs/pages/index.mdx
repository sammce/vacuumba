# Vacuumba report

## Prerequisites

- To navigate between the different sections of the documentation, click the menu icon at the
  top left of the screen. This will open a drawer of links around the site.

- Any word counts exclude titles, tables, images and code where applicable.

- Each stage's bibliography can be found at the bottom of its respective page.
  Every reference will have a footnote (e.g. [^1], [^2] etc) which you can click
  on to highlight that reference in the bibliography section.

- This website has been compiled from React to static HTML to adhere to brief instructions.
  As a result you cannot read the code (easily anyway). I have included the report website's source code
  in `Report/source`.

- With the deadline extension, I made a <Link href="./connect.html">Connect Four</Link> game.
  Try it with a loved one if you want to take a break.

N.B The bibliography on this page is for showcase purposes only.

<NextPrevLink
  next={{
    href: "plan",
    label: "Investigation & Plan",
  }}
